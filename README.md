## Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

### Problem Statement
   My case study is based on a computer hardware business facing challenges due to declining sales in a rapidly changing market.
   To address this, the Sales Director has decided to invest in a data analytics project and develop a Power BI dashboard. 
   This will provide real-time sales insights and support data-driven decision-making to improve business performance.

### Purpose
   TO unlock sales insights that are not visible before for sales team for decision support and automate them to reduced manual time spent in data gathering.

### Steps to the PowerBI dashboard 

 1. SQL database dump is in db_dump.sql file. Download `db_dump.sql` file to your local computer and import it.

### SQL commands to know the information about the given data

1. Show all customer records

    `SELECT * FROM customers;`

1. Show total number of customers

    `SELECT count(*) FROM customers;`

1. Show transactions for Chennai market (market code for chennai is Mark001)

    `SELECT * FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';`

1. Show distrinct product codes that were sold in chennai

    `SELECT distinct product_code FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';`

1. Show transactions where currency is US dollars

    `SELECT * from transactions where currency="USD"`

1. Show transactions in 2020 join by date table

    `SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020;`

1. Show total revenue in year 2020,

    `SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r";`
	
1. Show total revenue in year 2020, January Month,

    `SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and and date.month_name="January" and (transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r");`

1. Show total revenue in year 2020 in Chennai

    `SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020
and transactions.market_code="Mark001";`


Data Analysis Using Power BI
============================

1. Formula to create norm_amount column

`= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] ="USD#(cr)" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount], type any)`
